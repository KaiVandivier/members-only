# "Members only"

This is a silly little message board intended to be an exercise in user authentication.

Anyone can read messages and users can post messages, but only users who enter a secret passcode to become a "member" can see who wrote each message.  Users with admin privileges can delete messages.

[Play around with it here](https://shrouded-plains-79392.herokuapp.com/)

To become a member, the code is: `toocoolforschool`
To try out a user with admin priveleges, sign in with the credentials username: `user1` password: `password1`
